#Meta-expression of gut microbiota of the giant panda during diet transition period
----

**Abstract**

The gut microbiome is important to the host related in nutrition, metabolism and other aspects. For the endangered mammal giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleura), studying the gut microbiota is particularly critical. The panda has evolved successfully with bamboo as its exclusive diet. However, the genome sequence of this mammal confirmed its carnivorous digesting system lacking genes encoding enzymes for cellulose and hemicellulose metabolism. Therefore, intestinal microbiota likely play the major role in the panda digestion of bamboo.

A previous study of gut microbiotas of 15 pandas by Zhu et al. (2011) has reported a high proportion of Firmicutes OTUs among which 13 belonging to Clostridium group I and XIVa s that contain organisms known to digest cellulose. He also applied metagenomic sequencing approach enabling the prediction of 49,844 genes from the panda microbiota, among which 189 encodes GH family enzymes for the digestion of plant structural polysaccharides. This study strongly suggests that giant pandas have evolved its featured gut microbiota adapted to the digestion of bamboo, which is supported by other studies. However, a recent study of gut microbiotas of 45 pandas by Xue et al. (2015) was unable to recapture the microbiota composition reported by pervious one, which illustrated a more resembling phylogeny-related carnivore gut microbiome than the diet-related herbivores, challenges the predicted function of microbiota in bamboo digestion. Therefore, we still need more depth research to answer the question that how the giant panda using a carnivore similar gut flora to digest cellulose in bamboo.

An important key in understanding the function of panda gut microbiota is the diet transition period. In this stage, the main diet changes from milk to bamboo that will contribute significantly to the development of gut microbiota.

In this study, we collected fecal samples from six captive panda cubs during summer (May) and winter (November) of 2013, at their ages of 0.5- and 1-year old, or 1.5- and 2-year old. In these pandas, the diet changed from ~600 mL of milk for the 0.5-year old cubs to exclusive 7-kg bamboo for the 2-year old pandas per day. Our study was covered both summer and winter, which allowed us to analyze how the microbiotas of pandas responded to seasonal switch. We extracted genomic DNA and total RNA from the same fecal samples used for library preparation and applied both metagenomic and metaRNA-seq approaches to capture the microbiota dynamics.

**1. Metagenomics technology illustrated the gut microbiome structural and potential functional shifts of the giant panda in the transition period**

After metagenomic sequencing, we obtained a total of ~404 million high-quality reads from all 12 samples, that assembled 582,082 contigs. We used different bioinformatics databases to analyze the microbiome communities (SILVA, MetaPhlAn2, MBGD) and potential functions (COG-eggNOG, Pfam). A total of 457,013 contigs (78.5%) were annotated by at least one of the five databases.

Statistics of the rDNA abundance show that Firmicutes were the most dominant in panda microbiota, followed by Proteobacteria. The giant panda intestinal environment seems to evolve a good preparation for cellulose digestion, that we detected almost all of the gut cellulolytic bacterial species pervious reported in each panda, even in 0.5-year fresh milk ones. However, their abundances have a great change with the age growth. For example Lactobacillus is the most abundant genus in youngest group but difficult to find in any older ones. Interest, both of cluster analysis and principal component analysis shows that season is the most important factor affecting intestinal microflora of giant pandas, instead of age element.

The most abundant functional categories in COG include amino acid transport and metabolism, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, as well as energy production and conversion, underlining the importance of panda gut microbiota in nutrient supply. We next analyzed the differential abundant genes between summer and winter, finding the coordinated up-regulated abundance of genes in carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes, galactose metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism that confirmed the season factor for gut microbiome nutritional function.

To explore the cellulose digesting effects, we next focus on the genes related to carbohydrate enzymes. A total of 3,541 putative GH-encoded genes were annotated from the Pfam database. Among these, a high level (60.7%, 2150/3541) encoded GH enzymes targeting plant structural polysaccharides. Predictably, copy numbers of different GH genes altered significantly according to the age groups. Inter-individual variation was more significant among summer samples than the winter.

**2. Meta-transcriptomics technology investigated the activities and carbohydrate functional expression of the giant panda intestinal microbiome**

In the meta-RNAseq approach, we obtained totally ~527 million reads of the cDNA sequence from all rRNA, tRNA and mRNA. Since the currently premature meta-transcriptomics algorithm combined our obtained low level of mRNA, we could not further analyze much for every general expressed function but that gives us opportunities to explore bacterial activates and carbohydrate performance.

No surprisely, we found mainly functional bacterial species, especially for the digesting microorganisms show transcriptional pronounced since their larger rRNA proportions than rDNA. For example, the amount of two carbohydrates digesting related bacterial phylum Firmicutes and Proteobacteria keep in ~90% proportion among all samples, both far higher than their rDNA. We also discovered the amount number of activated bacterial species (rRNA/rDNA>1) in summer were much more than that in winter, which further supports seasonal differences.
Although cellulose-digestion-related CAZymes genes detected from metagenomics in 0.5-year group illustrated a strong potential ability of cellulose degradation in early childhood of pandas, metaRNA-seq showed a low expressional level of assembled GH genes in the fresh milk period. In contrast, with the diet transition, the capacity of cellulose utilization was revealed in the CAZymes expression. Similar to previous results, the major population of GH genes expressed at much higher levels in winter than in summer, supports the enhanced bamboo digestion function encoded by panda microbiota in winter.
Conclusion

**In summary**, the combination of comprehensive metagenomic and meta-expression study of gut microbiota of panda cubs during their diet transition period has reached several important findings. Firstly, 0.5-year panda cubs already reach a complex and diverse microbiota structure. The microbiota further develops to a more stable composition with the adding supplement of cellulose diet. Seasonal switch represents an independent factor for microbiota variation, and has a much stronger effect than other elements on the development of panda gut microbiota. Secondly, panda microbiota encodes abundant enzymes for bamboo utilization. The digestion function by gut microbiota primarily targets oligosaccharide digestion, and the early step of digesting cellulose and hemicellulose could have been performed by microbiota in the upper digestive tract. Thirdly, the function of gut microbiota is also regulated at the expression level, in addition to the metagenomic composition. The microbiota activity and carbohydrate performance at the expression level gives us a more comprehensive understanding of microbiota function and applications. Further study of such interplay in the intestinal microbiome of panda living in other stages could contribute to the field in a very unique way.
